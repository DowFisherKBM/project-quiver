### 3.1. Test Aim
A summary of why the test will be conducted

### 3.2. Test Plan
How the test will be conducted

## 4. Preflight Checklist
### 4.1. Airframe Inspection

!!! On markdown, you check a checkmark by placing an "x" between the brackets. !!!

- [x] Visual check (no cracks, loose fasteners, damage) 

- [ ] Structural mounting points (battery, payload) secure

Photos from the airframe, details where necessary

### 4.2. Propulsion / Power System

- [ ] Propeller(s) securely fastened, free of damage

- [ ] Battery charge adequate. Battery Voltage:

### 4.3. Avionics / Electronics

- [ ] Check all physical connections on the PCB and Pixhawk.

- [ ] Contactor working smoothly

- [ ] All pre-flight checks OK on the ground station

- [ ] RC remote & telemetry connections stable

### 4.4. Pilot Notes

- [ ] Flight plan reviewed

- [ ] IMSAFE (No Flying Under Influence)
 
Anything missing on the aircraft, anything that doesn't feel right

## 5. Flight Test

### 5.1. Ground Run:
- Arm the vehicle
- Give 20% throttle input
- Observe the ground station for any errors, propellers are spinning with similar speeds in the right directions

- [ ] No errors on ground station

- [ ] Propellers spinning with similar speeds

- [ ] Propellers spinning in the right directions

- [ ] Battery charge adequate. Battery voltage after ground run: 

### 5.2. Flight Test:
Perform the flight test. 

Log any observations/feelings for the test here.

What did you do during the test, what inputs did you give, how did the aircraft behave, which plans did you achieve.

This section can be used for tests with multiple flight legs.

eg

**Leg ID (If Any)**

#### Flight Feeling & Observations
- The aircraft felt generally stable and responsive in calm wind conditions
- I noted occasional minor drift to the left when in a steady hover

#### Pilot Actions/Inputs
- Executed a 360° turn at a moderate bank angle
- Tested the autopilot’s loiter mode at 50 meters AGL

#### Aircraft Behavior
- Autopilot loiter mode held altitude within ±2 meters, drift was minimal
- There was a slight yaw drift (Editor's note: NO PLEASE!!!)

#### Flight Plan Achievement
- Record battery consumption during hover tests: Completed
-  Ascend to 500 ft: Not completed due to other drones in the area

#### Recommendations
- Plan a test in slightly higher wind for next session to assess crosswind performance
- Revise PID gains for yaw oscillations

## Brief
#### Title of the project:

* Brush Bullet Applicator Initial Modeling Modification For Drones

#### Brief project description:
* Thomas got a set of herbicide pellet delivery device which called Brush Pod. That was originally designed for manned-helicopter mounting. We plan to use the same 3D printing method to modify it to fit the multi-purpose drone mount.

#### Why do you think this work is necessary?
* This may be the first payload of our multi-purpose drone to be tested.
* Other structural engineering personnel are currently too busy for modeling this.

#### Is there any related work this builds upon?
* Further refinement and continuous updates of the modified Brush Pod.

#### Will the results of this project be entirely open source? 
* Yes.

#### If this grant is successfully completed, how does it help the pod involved?
* Providing feasibility testing for further precise 3D printing parts.
* Reduce the use of machined fasteners in such design.
* Further align-up the workflow within Onshape software.

#### If this grant is successfully completed, how does it help Arrow?
* Faster progress to the test flight of multi-purpose drones and the trial operation of vegetation control services.
* Gain experience in the actual grant application process.

## Work Details
#### Do you need any input from another bounty/grant before the final submission?
* No

#### What is the breakdown of the proposed work, in terms of milestones and/or deadlines?
* 15 Days in total of
  * 3 days Initial modeling (already done) 
  * 11 days print, test, model refine
  * 1 day descripting and Grant Application submitting 
* Ideal deadline: 240102

#### List the details of the problem and what you want to accomplish with this grant.
* Can't perform that size of 3d print at home, need on-site printing and remote testing support.

#### What outcomes do you anticipate from the grant? Please list all deliverables along with their specific due dates.
* 3d printable mount arm design.
* 3d printable new brush pod container and lid design.
* A simple user manual (maybe).
*(Dates are listed above)*

#### In which areas can this work be used? What is the scope of its applicability?
* Multi-purpose drone with brush bullet dispenser flight test or even the actual vegetation control business.

#### What metrics will be used to evaluate the outcomes of the project? 
* Structural strength
* Accessibility 
* Maintainability 
* In-flight reliability

## Risk Assessment
#### What are the potential risks or challenges for this project?
* Several times of design and material changes.
* Can't perform real-world verification of the actual product at home.

#### How will these risks be managed or mitigated?
* Inner peace.

#### How will you handle unforeseen obstacles or delays?
* Re-design any features or slicing in case of printing failure.

#### Is there a long-term plan for updating or improving the work over time?
* Yes if there's any design failure.

#### What steps can be taken to ensure the longevity and sustainability of the work?
* The model space is already well-commented.
* 3d printer and slicing parameter should be archived for future reference.

## Costs
#### How many work hours will be spent on this grant?
* 72

#### How much USDC/ARROW is the applicant requesting?
* 270 USDC
* 30 ARROW

#### How does the amount requested represent good value for Arrow?
* A long-term support and low-cost structural design project can be maintained.

#### What is the proposed payment schedule for the grant? E.g. single payment, multiple payments?
* Single
* After the debrief

#### How will the GBC verify that the work delivered matches the proposed cadence?
* Install and fly it or smash it aggressively.
* Keep away from heavy rain.

#### What alternatives or options have been considered in order to save costs for the proposed project?
* This one has guessed there's no other option for this device.
* Use a card box and cut a hole on it is not an option. 

#### Have you examples of similar work you have completed in the past?
* Normal experiences: 3d printed UAV accessories such as PDB casing.
